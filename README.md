# AI Stylist

## Problem Description

Shopping for fashion online can be overwhelming due to the vast number of products, styles, and brands available. Customers often struggle to find items that match their preferences, occasions, and budgets, especially when searching for specific requirements like business casual attire, wedding outfits, or color and style combinations.

**AI Stylist** solves this problem by providing an intelligent assistant that understands natural language queries about fashion needs. It leverages advanced retrieval and language models to:

- Interpret user questions and extract key concepts (e.g., product type, style, color, budget, occasion).
- Search a large product catalog using hybrid vector search for relevant items.
- Recommend the best-suited products based on user context and catalog data.
- Provide clear, concise, and personalized fashion advice.

This project streamlines the shopping experience, making it easier for users to discover and select products that fit their unique requirements.

## Features
- Natural language understanding for fashion queries
- Concept extraction and context-aware recommendations
- Hybrid vector search for accurate product retrieval
- Integration with Anthropic LLM and Qdrant vector database
- Modular, extensible Python codebase

## Usage
Run the assistant and ask questions like:
- "I am a woman and need business casual attire."
- "Looking for a red dress for a party under 2000 INR."
- "Suggest an outfit for an Indian wedding."

The AI Stylist will recommend products and explain why they are suitable for your needs.
